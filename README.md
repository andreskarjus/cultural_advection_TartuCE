- Scripts to replicate the analyses presented at the Applications in Cultural Evolution conference, June 5-8, Tartu, Estonia, as:
- Andres Karjus, "Selection above the baseline: quantifying the advection effect in four domains of cumulative culture"
- All the scripts are R. You'll need a bunch of packages; here's a handy command to install them: 
`install.packages(c("visNetwork", "igraph", "XML", "magrittr", "plotly", "crosstalk", "parallel", "fastmatch", "text2vec", "grr", "Matrix", "compiler"))`
- Refer to the links in https://andreskarjus.github.io/cultevol_tartu_slides or within the scripts for the places to download the datasets.

- If you make use of these scripts, please cite the following: Andres Karjus, Richard A. Blythe, Simon Kirby, Kenny Smith, 2018. Quantifying the dynamics of topical fluctuations in language. arXiv preprint. https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00699
- Feel free to get in touch if something does not work.
