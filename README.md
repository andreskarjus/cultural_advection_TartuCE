- Scripts to replicate the analyses presented at the [Applications in Cultural Evolution](https://cultevol.ut.ee/) conference, June 5-8, Tartu, Estonia, as:
- Andres Karjus, "Selection above the baseline: quantifying the advection effect in four domains of cumulative culture"
- All the scripts are in R. You'll need a bunch of packages; here's a handy command to install them: 
`install.packages(c("visNetwork", "igraph", "XML", "magrittr", "plotly", "crosstalk", "parallel", "fastmatch", "text2vec", "grr", "Matrix", "compiler"))`
- Refer to the links in https://andreskarjus.github.io/cultevol_tartu_slides or within the scripts for the places to download the datasets (or the handy unofficial dumps).

- If you make use of these scripts, please cite the following paper which defines and describes the model: Andres Karjus, Richard A. Blythe, Simon Kirby, Kenny Smith, 2018. Quantifying the dynamics of topical fluctuations in language. arXiv preprint. https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00699. bib: 
```

- If you make use of the customized plotting scripts, besides the obvious package citations, I'd appreciate a mention of the following repo: Karjus, Andres (2018). aRt of the Figure. GitHub repository, https://github.com/andreskarjus/artofthefigure. bib:
